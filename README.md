# Degree-Audit-Online-Application--
Currently, CS students of UTD need to schedule an appointment with their academic advisor to go through a degree plan audit before their applications to graduate processed. 
Our application aims to provide a pre-screening of the degree plan, so that the students can know what they’ve done and what they still need before going to an advisor. 
The application is supposed to give out a report of whether the student has met all the prerequisites,
core courses, total credits, core GPA, and overall GPA based on the user’s input.

Generally, we used CSS, PHP, Javascript, and HTML to code the application. More specifically, we used the Laravel framework to organize the whole project. We stored all the views in the Resource folder under the main directory, and all the controller in the app folder. The web.php in Route folder is a connection between view and controller, it records down the route from a certain url to a respective method in controller, or in the other way, it can also have embedded method inside the web.php file to react the incoming request.
